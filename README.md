# Horiseon Code Refactor: Meeting accessibility standards

To improve the overall accessibility and profile of Horiseon’s website, I have taken existing HTML and CSS and made several improvements. I have updated the code to include semantic HTML and accessibility tags, features which will make the site user friendly for those using screen readers. I have also reviewed the code for errors and/or redundancies, making improvements where applicable. 

In making these changes, the code has become more user friendly, and the client’s website has been optimized for search engines.
